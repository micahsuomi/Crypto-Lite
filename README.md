## Market Prices

In this page users can view market prices and price changes for the top 100 cryptocurrencies based on the CryptoCompare API. The page displays the top 5 gainers and top 5 losers updated in real time based on percentage change per day. The market prices table has a table head where the user can sort crypto based on price, percentage change, market cap and circulating supply. Each crypto displayed has an add to watchlist button to allow the user to add selected currencies to a watchlist. By clicking on each coin, users can view more details for each cryptocurrency.

## News

News for cryptocurrencies are another feature brought by the CryptoCompare APIs. This page displays 50 news items divided in 5 pages and updated in real time from the API. Each news article, when clicked, redirects to its original publisher, as a way to generate more clicks for that particular crypto website.

## Watchlist

In this watchlist cart are displayed all the cryptocurrencies added to the watchlist, which the user can remove. If there are no currencies on the watchlist, this page is not clickable.

## Currency Converter

With the currency converter, users can convert a selected amount of USDT into crypto and vice versa. After converting into currency, the conversion can be saved on a table displayed on the right, that the user can always access or from which the saved conversion can be later deleted.
